<p>This is a portfolio generator.
<p>It is broken up into 2 main classes "portfolio" and "mf" 
<p>mf are initials for my first and last name.
<p>The intention is to give it scalability (add other people and see what their portfolio looks like).
<p>The portfolio class is used to create new "people" objects (ex: mf) and and output the desired information about them. 
<p>Within mf are subclasses representing skills, education, and work experience. They contain data structure methods.
<p>Within the subclasses mentioned above are subclasses which hold the raw data that will be utilized.
