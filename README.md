This is a portfolio generator.
It is broken up into 2 main classes "portfolio" and "mf" 
mf are initials for my first and last name. 
The intention is to give it scalability (add other people and see what their portfolio looks like).
The portfolio class is used to create new "people" objects (ex: mf) and and output the desired information about them. 
Within mf are subclasses representing skills, education, and work experience. They contain data structure methods.
Within the subclasses mentioned above are subclasses which hold the raw data that will be utilized.
